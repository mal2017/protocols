Works well with 10-25 million cells. Unless otherwise noted keep all steps on ice. Work quickly and reduce handling of material as much as possible. For example, never pipette mix when resuspension in a rotator at 4c would suffice. When using a bioruptor, 0.5% SDS is usually optimal. Qsonica requires 1% SDS. Before starting, make buffered stocks of HEPES and Tris. Workflow Protocol Fixation (Can be performed well in advance) Make 11% formaldehyde fixation solution fresh (see below). Add volume of fixation solution equal to 1/10 of the culture volume. Incubate at RT on rocker for 10-15 minutes (optimize for cell type and IP target). Quench with volume of 2.5M glycine equal to 1/20 culture volume. If adherent: Rinse 2x with chilled PBS+PIC at 1X concentration. Add small volume of PBS+PIC (dependent on dish size) and scrape with cell scrapers or alternatively bent 200ul pipette tip. Transfer scraped cells to conical (50ml or 15ml). Wash: Spin at 4c @ 1350g for 5min. Aspirate supernatant. Resuspend in cold 1X PBS+PIC. Repeat 2x. Collect cells by spinning at 4c @ 1350g for 5min, aspirate supernatant. Cells are now ready for lysis. Alternatively snap freeze by dunking conical into LN2 and immediately transfer to -80c. Bead setup (Day 0 or Day 1) Wash 25ul Protein G DynaBeads 3x5min in 1ml blocking buffer using magnetic rack and aspirating all buffer with each wash. Add 500ul blocking buffer to tub with trapped beads Add antibody (usually 5-10ug) to this buffer. Do not bother resuspending manually. Instead rotate end over end at 4c for minimum 5 hrs. Lysis (Day 1) Resuspend pellet in chilled LB1+PIC (&gt;=1ml/1e6 cells) and incubate 10 minutes @ 4c while rotating. Pellet cells at 1350g for 5min @ 4c, aspirate supernatant. Repeat the previous two steps using LB2+PIC. Resuspend in appropriate volume SB+PIC with SDS at optimized percentage. Sonication (Day 1) Sonicate using parameters optimized for instrument, cell type, and cell number. Spin sonicated material at 20,000g for 10min at 4c to clarify. Collect supernatant and transfer to a new tube. Discard pellet (debris). Set aside ~10% total sonicated volume for use as input (non-IP control) and store at -20c. Dilute remaining sonicated chromatin with SB+PIC such that %SDS &lt; 0.1%. Chromatin can be stored at 4c for several days. IP (Day 1) Wash antibody-bead complex 3x5min in cold blocking buffer. Resuspend in 500ul cold blocking buffer. Gently add bead suspension to sonicated chromatin. Rotate end over end at 4c overnight. Bead Wash (Day 2) Collect bead-antibody-chromatin on magnetic rack, aspirate SB + debris. Wash end over end 5min at 4c in each of the following buffers. After each wash, collect beads with magnet, aspirate. Twice in SB High salt SB LiCl wash buffer TE+NaCl (add 10ul 5M NaCl for every 1ml TE) Remove as much of final wash as possible while beads are trapped by the magnetic rack. If necessary, spin at 4c at 960g for 3 minutes then return to magnetic rack and aspirate again. At this point, dna can be eluted in EB (see below), crosslinks reversed, RNAse and Proteinase K treated, and then purified via column or phenol chloroform extraction. Alteratively, continue on to produce NGS libraries via tagmentation. IP Tagmentation (Day 2) Wash Beads once in 10mM Tris HCl, pH 8. Resuspend beads in 25ul Tagmentation Reaction. Incubate at 37c for up to 10 minutes (optimize if necessary). Add 1ml cold Tagmentation Wash Buffer and incubate 5 minutes on ice. Wash beads 2x in Tagmentation Wash Buffer 2x in TE Table 1: Per sample IP Tagmentation Reaction Ingredient Vol 1X Tagmentation Buffer 24ul Tn5 Enzyme 1ul Target-Ab-Bead Conjugate - Elution (Day 2) Trap beads on magnet and remove TE. Resuspend in 200ul EB and incubate at 65c for 15 minutes, vortexing every 5 minutes. Collect beads by centrifuging @ 20,000g or trap on magnetic rack and transfer to fresh tube. Reverse crosslinks (Day 2) Resuspend in 200ul Elution Buffer. At this point, retrieve input samples and bring to the same volume as IP samples using Elution Buffer. Reverse crosslinks at 65c overnight. Purification (Day 3) Add 200ul TE to each tube. Add RNase A to a final concentration of 0.2mg/ml (8ul if stock is 10mg/ml). Mix gently and incubate at 37c for 2hrs. Add 7ul 300mM CaCl2 in 10mM Tris-HCL, pH8. Add Proteinase K to a concentration of 0.2mg/ml (4ul if stock is 20mg/ml). Mix gently and incubate at 55c for 30min. Purify Using Minelute Kit or similar column-based extraction. Input Tagmentation (Day 3) Purified input DNA can be quantified via Qubit. 2.5ng should be set aside for tagmentation. Create master mix of 1:10 diluted Transposase. Create a 5ul reaction for each 2.5ng of input DNA (see per sample recipe below). Incubate 5min at 55c. During incubation prepare 0.6% SDS master mix (60ul 10% SDS in 940ul Nuclease Free H20). Add 1ul SDS mix to each input reaction and incubate 5min @ RT. Bring up to 10ul with Nuclease Free H20. Continue with amplification alongside IP samples.

Trap with magnet for ~10min to ensure full bead engagement with magnet. Remove supernatant. Wash briefly 2x with fresh 80% EtOH and remove EtOH. Dry with open caps for approx. 5min. Can be placed in incubator for additional speed. Remove from magnets and resuspend beads in 50ul Nuclease Free H20. Incubate 10 minutes @ RT. Place back on magnet and trap beads for 5min, then carefully place supernatant in fresh 1.7ml tube. Size Selection (Day 3 or 4) Add 32.5ul (65% of 50ul) Ampure XP Beads, mix 10x with pipette and incubate 10min @ RT. Trap beads on magnet for 10min, then transfer supernatant to fresh tube, discarding the beads. Add 12.5ul of Ampure XP Beads, mix 10x by pipette, and incubate 10min @ RT.
