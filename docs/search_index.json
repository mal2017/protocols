["cell-line-chip-seq.html", "Cell Line ChIP-seq Notes Workflow Protocol Buffers Other Reagents + equipment", " Cell Line ChIP-seq Notes This protocol is adapted from the ChIP protocol used in the Bradner Lab and Christoph Bockâ€™s tagmentation v1.1. Works well with 10-25 million cells. Unless otherwise noted keep all steps on ice. Work quickly and reduce handling of material as much as possible. For example, never pipette mix when resuspension in a rotator at 4c would suffice. When using a bioruptor, 0.5% SDS is usually optimal. Qsonica requires 1% SDS. Before starting, make buffered stocks of HEPES and Tris. Workflow Protocol Fixation (Can be performed well in advance) Make 11% formaldehyde fixation solution fresh (see below). Add volume of fixation solution equal to 1/10 of the culture volume. Incubate at RT on rocker for 10-15 minutes (optimize for cell type and IP target). Quench with volume of 2.5M glycine equal to 1/20 culture volume. If adherent: Rinse 2x with chilled PBS+PIC at 1X concentration. Add small volume of PBS+PIC (dependent on dish size) and scrape with cell scrapers or alternatively bent 200ul pipette tip. Transfer scraped cells to conical (50ml or 15ml). Wash: Spin at 4c @ 1350g for 5min. Aspirate supernatant. Resuspend in cold 1X PBS+PIC. Repeat 2x. Collect cells by spinning at 4c @ 1350g for 5min, aspirate supernatant. Cells are now ready for lysis. Alternatively snap freeze by dunking conical into LN2 and immediately transfer to -80c. Bead setup (Day 0 or Day 1) Wash 25ul Protein G DynaBeads 3x5min in 1ml blocking buffer using magnetic rack and aspirating all buffer with each wash. Add 500ul blocking buffer to tub with trapped beads Add antibody (usually 5-10ug) to this buffer. Do not bother resuspending manually. Instead rotate end over end at 4c for minimum 5 hrs. Lysis (Day 1) Resuspend pellet in chilled LB1+PIC (&gt;=1ml/1e6 cells) and incubate 10 minutes @ 4c while rotating. Pellet cells at 1350g for 5min @ 4c, aspirate supernatant. Repeat the previous two steps using LB2+PIC. Resuspend in appropriate volume SB+PIC with SDS at optimized percentage. Sonication (Day 1) Sonicate using parameters optimized for instrument, cell type, and cell number. Spin sonicated material at 20,000g for 10min at 4c to clarify. Collect supernatant and transfer to a new tube. Discard pellet (debris). Set aside ~10% total sonicated volume for use as input (non-IP control) and store at -20c. Dilute remaining sonicated chromatin with SB+PIC such that %SDS &lt; 0.1%. Chromatin can be stored at 4c for several days. IP (Day 1) Wash antibody-bead complex 3x5min in cold blocking buffer. Resuspend in 500ul cold blocking buffer. Gently add bead suspension to sonicated chromatin. Rotate end over end at 4c overnight. Bead Wash (Day 2) Collect bead-antibody-chromatin on magnetic rack, aspirate SB + debris. Wash end over end 5min at 4c in each of the following buffers. After each wash, collect beads with magnet, aspirate. Twice in SB High salt SB LiCl wash buffer TE+NaCl (add 10ul 5M NaCl for every 1ml TE) Remove as much of final wash as possible while beads are trapped by the magnetic rack. If necessary, spin at 4c at 960g for 3 minutes then return to magnetic rack and aspirate again. At this point, dna can be eluted in EB (see below), crosslinks reversed, RNAse and Proteinase K treated, and then purified via column or phenol chloroform extraction. Alteratively, continue on to produce NGS libraries via tagmentation. IP Tagmentation (Day 2) Wash Beads once in 10mM Tris HCl, pH 8. Resuspend beads in 25ul Tagmentation Reaction. Incubate at 37c for up to 10 minutes (optimize if necessary). Add 1ml cold Tagmentation Wash Buffer and incubate 5 minutes on ice. Wash beads 2x in Tagmentation Wash Buffer 2x in TE Table 1: Per sample IP Tagmentation Reaction Ingredient Vol 1X Tagmentation Buffer 24ul Tn5 Enzyme 1ul Target-Ab-Bead Conjugate - Elution (Day 2) Trap beads on magnet and remove TE. Resuspend in 200ul EB and incubate at 65c for 15 minutes, vortexing every 5 minutes. Collect beads by centrifuging @ 20,000g or trap on magnetic rack and transfer to fresh tube. Reverse crosslinks (Day 2) Resuspend in 200ul Elution Buffer. At this point, retrieve input samples and bring to the same volume as IP samples using Elution Buffer. Reverse crosslinks at 65c overnight. Purification (Day 3) Add 200ul TE to each tube. Add RNase A to a final concentration of 0.2mg/ml (8ul if stock is 10mg/ml). Mix gently and incubate at 37c for 2hrs. Add 7ul 300mM CaCl2 in 10mM Tris-HCL, pH8. Add Proteinase K to a concentration of 0.2mg/ml (4ul if stock is 20mg/ml). Mix gently and incubate at 55c for 30min. Purify Using Minelute Kit or similar column-based extraction. Input Tagmentation (Day 3) Purified input DNA can be quantified via Qubit. 2.5ng should be set aside for tagmentation. Create master mix of 1:10 diluted Transposase. Create a 5ul reaction for each 2.5ng of input DNA (see per sample recipe below). Incubate 5min at 55c. During incubation prepare 0.6% SDS master mix (60ul 10% SDS in 940ul Nuclease Free H20). Add 1ul SDS mix to each input reaction and incubate 5min @ RT. Bring up to 10ul with Nuclease Free H20. Continue with amplification alongside IP samples. Table 2: Per sample Input Tagmentation Reaction Ingredient Vol 2.5ng Eluted input DNA - 0.1X Tn5 Enzyme 1ul 1X Tagmentation Buffer Up to 5ul Amplification (Day 3 or 4) Prepare for each sample a Library Amplification Reaction as specified in the table below. Preamplify in a thermocycler according to the following program: 72c for 5min 98c for 30 seconds 5 cycles: 98c for 10 seconds 63c for 30 seconds 72c for 1 minute Store this preamplified material at 4c. Prepare qPCR side reaction as described in table below. Using a qPCR instrument, perform the following: 98c for 30 seconds 20 cycles: 98c for 10 seconds 63c for 30 seconds 72c for 1 min Plot linear Rn vs cycle count and find the cycle count that corresponds to 1/4 the maximum Rn value. his is the number of additional cycles to perform in a standard thermocycler for each sample.

Trap with magnet for ~10min to ensure full bead engagement with magnet. Remove supernatant. Wash briefly 2x with fresh 80% EtOH and remove EtOH. Dry with open caps for approx. 5min. Can be placed in incubator for additional speed. Remove from magnets and resuspend beads in 50ul Nuclease Free H20. Incubate 10 minutes @ RT. Place back on magnet and trap beads for 5min, then carefully place supernatant in fresh 1.7ml tube. Size Selection (Day 3 or 4) Add 32.5ul (65% of 50ul) Ampure XP Beads, mix 10x with pipette and incubate 10min @ RT. Trap beads on magnet for 10min, then transfer supernatant to fresh tube, discarding the beads. Add 12.5ul of Ampure XP Beads, mix 10x by pipette, and incubate 10min @ RT. Trap beads with magnet for 10min and discard supernatant. Wash beads twice with fresh 80% EtOH and remove EtOH. Dry with caps open 5min on magnet. Remove from magnet and resuspend beads in 15ul Nuclease Free H20. Incubate 10min. Return tubes to magnet rack and trap beads for 5min. Transfer supernatant to new tube. This is the final library.

["chip-rx.html", "ChIP-rx Notes Workflow Protocol", " ChIP-rx Notes This protocol is adapted from another Bradner Lab protocol and can be used in conjunction with just about any other ChIP-seq protocol. The exogenous spike-in can be any non-human cell that can reliably be aligned to another genome. In practice this is usually drosophila or mouse. Just make sure that that the organism you choose expresses a similar enough protein to your target that your ab can cross react (and of course double-check that your ab is in fact supposed to cross react). Exogenous cells should be spiked in at a constant rate across all samples - usually 5% to 20% of your experimental cells is fine, but some protocols go higher. Workflow Protocol Process accurately counted cells of interest through the initial lysis step of a ChIP protocol Calculate the total number of Rx cells necessary and lyse together in a master mix Distribute the appropriate volume of master mix to each sample lysate Continue with ChIP as normal "],
["qsonica-operation-chip-seq.html", "QSONICA Operation (ChIP-seq) Notes Workflow Protocol", " QSONICA Operation (ChIP-seq) Notes This protocol explains operation of the Q800R3 with automated cooler for chromatin shearing as part of a ChIP-seq protocol. Workflow Protocol Prep cell lysate early in the day. Lysate can sit at 4c in sonication buffer or several hours at least. Note that for QSONICA sonication 1% SDS is recommended. Divide the lysate such that approximately 1e7 cell equivalents of lysate are in 300ul Use 500ul thin wall tubes Place tubes in bottom of sample clamp. The clamp is composed of two 3d printed discs with holes for tubes around the disc as well as a threaded central hole. Screw these discs together firmly but without flexing the 3d printed plastic. Slot the clamp+tube complex into the cup horn attachment This should just gently fit into the cup horn, no forcing necessary Attach chiller tubes and fill with appropriate amount of H2O. Place the cup horn attachment in the sonication chamber Make sure that cup horn is seated flat and the the gears on the top of the cup horn and the sonication chamber are completely meshed Set desired sonication strength and on/off timing :15/:45 at 70% for 30 minutes of total sonication is a good starting point Make sure that the chamber is closed and turn the machine on. You can now walk away from the machine until it is finished. This will take several hours depending on the parameters used. Drain machine by attaching drainage hose and briefly running cooler pump.
