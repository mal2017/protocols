["cell-line-chip-bradner-lab-protocol.html", "Cell Line ChIP (Bradner Lab protocol) Notes Workflow Protocol Buffers Stocks Other Reagents + equipment", " Cell Line ChIP (Bradner Lab protocol) Notes This protocol is adapted from the ChIP protocol used in the Bradner Lab. Works well with 10-25 million cells. Unless otherwise noted keep all steps on ice. Work quickly and reduce handling of material as much as possible. For example, never pipette mix when resuspension in a rotator at 4c would suffice. When using a bioruptor, 0.5% SDS is usually optimal. Before starting, make buffered stocks of HEPES and Tris. Workflow Protocol Bead setup Wash 100ul Protein G DynaBeads 3x5min in 1ml blocking buffer using magnetic rack and aspirating all buffer with each wash. Add 500ul blocking buffer to tub with trapped beads Add antibody (usually 10ug) to this buffer. Do not bother resuspending manually. Instead rotate end over end at 4c for minimum 5 hrs. Fixation Make 11% formaldehyde fixation solution fresh (see below). Add volume of fixation solution equal to 1/10 of the culture volume. Incubate at RT on rocker for 10-15 minutes (optimize for cell type and IP target). Quench with volume of 2.5M glycine equal to 1/20 culture volume. If adherent: Rinse 2x with chilled PBS+PIC at 1X concentration. Add small volume of PBS+PIC (dependent on dish size) and scrape with cell scrapers or alternatively bent 200ul pipette tip. Transfer scraped cells to conical (50ml or 15ml). Wash: Spin at 4c @ 1350g for 5min. Aspirate supernatant. Resuspend in cold 1X PBS+PIC. Repeat 2x. Collect cells by spinning at 4c @ 1350g for 5min, aspirate supernatant. Cells are now ready for lysis. Alternatively snap freeze by dunking conical into LN2 and immediately transfer to -80c. Lysis Resuspend pellet in 5ml chilled LB1+PIC and incubate 10 minutes @ 4c while rotating. Pellet cells at 1350g for 5min @ 4c, aspirate supernatant. Repeat the previous two steps using LB2+PIC. Resuspend in appropriate volume SB+PIC with SDS at optimized percentage. Sonication Sonicate using parameters optimized for instrument and cell type. Spin sonicated material at 20,000g for 10min at 4c to clarify. Collect supernatant and transfer to a new tube. Discard pellet (debris). Set aside ~50ul for use as input (non-IP control) and store at -20c. Dilute remaining sonicated chromatin with SB+PIC such that %SDS &lt; 0.1%, ideally targeting &lt; 15ml total volume. IP Wash antibody-bead complex 3x5min in cold blocking buffer. Resuspend in 500ul cold blocking buffer. Gently add bead suspension to sonicated chromatin. Rotate end over end at 4c overnight. Bead Wash + Elution Collect bead-antibody-chromatin on magnetic rack, aspirate SB + debris. Wash end over end 5min at 4c in each of the following buffers. After each wash, collect beads with magnet, aspirate. Twice in SB High salt SB LiCl wash buffer TE+NaCl (add 10ul 5M NaCl for every 1ml TE) Remove as much of final wash as possible while beads are trapped by the magnetic rack. If necessary, spin at 4c at 960g for 3 minutes then return to magnetic rack and aspirate again. Gently resuspend in 210ul EB. Pipette mix vigorously or vortex. Elute chromatin by incubating at 65c for 15min. Vortex or pipette mix once every 5min. Spin at 20,000g to pellet beads and/or trap with magnetic rack. Transfer supernatant to fresh tube If input chromatin was saved, add EB to input chromatin such that IP and input are in the same volume. Reverse crosslinks overnight, ~16hrs at 65c. Purification Add 200ul TE to each tube. Add RNAseA to a concentration of 0.2mg/ml to each tube (8ul if stock is 10mg/ml). Mix gently then incubate at 37c for 2hrs. Add 7ul 300mM CaCl in 10mM ph8 Tris-HCL. Add proteinase K to a concentration of 0.2mg/ml (4ul if stock concentration is 20mg/ml). Mix and incubate 30min at 55c. Options: Proceed with phenol:chloroform:isoamyl extraction Use column based extraction (e.g. minelute).

["qsonica-operation-chip-seq.html", "QSONICA Operation (ChIP-seq) Notes Workflow Protocol", " QSONICA Operation (ChIP-seq) Notes This protocol explains operation of the Q800R3 with automated cooler for chromatin shearing as part of a ChIP-seq protocol. Workflow Protocol Prep cell lysate early in the day. Lysate can sit at 4c in sonication buffer or several hours at least. Note that for QSONICA sonication 1% SDS is recommended. Divide the lysate such that approximately 1e7 cell equivalents of lysate are in 300ul Use 500ul thin wall tubes Place tubes in bottom of sample clamp. The clamp is composed of two 3d printed discs with holes for tubes around the disc as well as a threaded central hole. Screw these discs together firmly but without flexing the 3d printed plastic. Slot the clamp+tube complex into the cup horn attachment This should just gently fit into the cup horn, no forcing necessary Attach chiller tubes and fill with appropriate amount of H2O. Place the cup horn attachment in the sonication chamber Make sure that cup horn is seated flat and the the gears on the top of the cup horn and the sonication chamber are completely meshed Set desired sonication strength and on/off timing :15/:45 at 70% for 30 minutes of total sonication is a good starting point Make sure that the chamber is closed and turn the machine on. You can now walk away from the machine until it is finished. This will take several hours depending on the parameters used. Drain machine by attaching drainage hose and briefly running cooler pump.
